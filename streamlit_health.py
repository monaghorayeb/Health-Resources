    2 columns showing the total count of care centers and first aid centers in the town.

  - **Existence of nearby care centers - exists and not exists**: 
    Shows whether nearby care centers exist (1 for yes, 0 for no).

  - **Existence of health resources - exists and not exists**: 
    Indicates if general health resources exist in the town.

  - **Town**: 
    The name of the town being described.

  - **refArea**: 
    Refers to the geographical area or governorate where the town is located.

  - **Observation URI**: 
    A link to the URI containing detailed observations of the townâ€™s health resources.

  - **Percentage of towns with special needs individuals - With and Without special needs**: 
    2 columns showing the percentage of the population with and without special needs.

  - **Existence of special needs care centers - exists and not exists**: 
    Indicates whether care centers for individuals with special needs exist (1 for yes, 0 for no).

  The column **refArea** was engineered to contain only the name of the area without the entire link for easier visualization.
